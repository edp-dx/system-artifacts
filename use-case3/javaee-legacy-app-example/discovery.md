# Technical Discovery

## What's the programming language and its version the project written with?

The programming language used in the project is Java, and the version specified in the settings is Java 1.6.

## What's the framework and its version the project written with?

The project is developed using the Java EE framework. Specific versions of Java EE technologies are indicated by the facets in the `.settings/org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.xml` files:

- `jst.ejb` version `2.1` (Enterprise JavaBeans)
- `jst.web` version `2.5` (Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages)
- `jst.ear` version `1.4` (Enterprise Archive)

These versions suggest that the project is likely compatible with Java EE 5.

## What's the building tool and its version the project written with?

The project files indicate that the building tool used for the project is Eclipse's Java Builder with the name `org.eclipse.jdt.core.javabuilder`. However, the version of the builder is not specified in the provided context.

## What's the deployment tool  and its version the project written with?

The context provided does not explicitly mention a specific deployment tool or its version used in the project. The information available pertains to project settings for Eclipse IDE, specifically for Java EE development with JBoss.

## What's the testing tool and its version the project written with?

The provided context does not specify any testing tools or their versions. It only contains project configuration details and Java compiler preferences.

## If Struts, JSP, JSF technologies are used in the project?

Struts and JSP are utilized in the project, but there is no mention of JSF in the provided context.

## What types of EJB beans are used in he project?

The project utilizes a Stateless Session Bean, as indicated by the `session-type` element set to `Stateless` in the `ejb-jar.xml` file for the `RegistrationEJB`.

## What's the external libraries and API are used at the project?

The provided context does not explicitly list any external libraries or APIs being utilized in the project. The context only shows project configuration files, including Eclipse project settings and manifest files, but does not provide information about specific external dependencies.

## Check if there is existing CI/CD pipelines in the project?

Yes, there are existing CI/CD pipelines in the project, as seen in the `pipelines` folder with files like `build.yaml` and `pipelinerun.yaml` that define a Tekton pipeline and its execution for building a project named `javaee-legacy-app-example`.

## What's the technology of CI/CD pipeline and its version?

The technology behind the CI/CD pipelines in the provided context is Tekton, and it is using version `v1beta1` of its API, as indicated in the `build.yaml` and `pipelinerun.yaml` files.

## Check if there is any quality gates in the existing CI/CD pipeline?

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of quality gates within the CI/CD pipeline configuration files. Quality gates usually involve steps like code analysis, testing, or security scanning, but these are not detailed in the `build.yaml` or `pipelinerun.yaml` files that define the pipeline and its execution.

## Analyze CI/CD pipelines for URL, names, namespace terms for the next injections: 'dev', 'prod', 'uat', 'test' and use that information to guess the number of deployment environments and their names.

Given the provided context, there is no direct evidence to conclusively determine the number of deployment environments or their names such as 'dev', 'prod', 'uat', or 'test'. The pipeline file `build.yaml` mentions a namespace 'dx-dev', which suggests a development environment, but information about other environments is not present. To gain insights into the number of deployment environments and their potential names, additional context or configuration files that contain environment-specific parameters would be required.

## Check if custom libraries are used for secrets encryption. List secrets encryption libraries if any.

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of custom libraries utilized for secrets encryption. The context does not include any information about specific libraries or tools used for encrypting secrets.

## Check if passwords are hard-coded in code.

Based on the provided context, there is no instance where passwords are hard-coded into the code.

## Check is SSL connection used between this app and a DB.

Based on the provided context, there is no information about the database configuration or the use of an SSL connection for database communication. The files shared pertain to web application configuration and deployment descriptors, Java EE security domain configuration, and web pages for login and secure content display. They do not include details about the database connection setup.

## Check if API requires secure connection (https, ssl ) if any.

The provided context does not explicitly state that a secure connection such as HTTPS or SSL is required for the API. There is no mention of any configuration that enforces the use of secure protocols in the provided files.

## Check if there are unit tests exists and if it is so, print the technologies list.

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about unit tests or the technologies utilized for testing within the project. The files and contents shared focus on project configuration, deployment notes, and project facets for a Java EE application, but do not include details on testing.

## Check if there are integration tests that uses real database.

Based on the context provided, there is no information about integration tests or database usage.

## Check if there are user friendly API description.

Based on the provided context, there is no user-friendly description of the API available in the files. The context consists of project configuration files, manifests, and a deployment note but does not include API documentation or descriptions.

## Check if there are hardcoded IP addresses.

No, there are no hardcoded IP addresses in the provided context that need to be verified.
